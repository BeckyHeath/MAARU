                <p class = "body-text"> As vital ecosystems across the globe enter unchartered pressure from climate 
                    change industrial land use, understanding the processes driving ecosystem viability has never been 
                    more critical. Nuanced ecosystem understanding comes from well-collected and representative field 
                    data. Advances in hardware and analytical methods have revolutionised ecological monitoring and 
                    made it possible to easily uncover a wealth of information that hasn’t before been possible.

                    Sound ecology (bioacoustics and ecoacoustics) describes the school of research that uses information
                     transmitted through waves of pressure (sound) to infer properties about an# area's species, 
                     biodiversity, and health.

                <p class = "body-text">Spatial acoustics takes this one step further. By recording a soundwave from 
                    multiple microphones simultaneously, we can use millisecond time differences to triangulate where a
                     sound has come from.

                    These delays can also be manipulated to amplify signals from a given direction through a beamforming.
