            <h2>Spatial Acoustics?</h2>

            <p>As vital ecosystems across the globe enter unchartered pressure from climate change 
                industrial land use, understanding the processes driving ecosystem viability has 
                never been more critical. Nuanced ecosystem understanding comes from well-collected 
                and representative field data. Advances in hardware and analytical methods have 
                revolutionised ecological monitoring and made it possible to easily uncover a wealth 
                of information that hasn’t before been possible.   </p>

            <p>Sound ecology (bioacoustics and ecoacoustics) describes the school of research that uses
                 information transmitted through waves of pressure (sound) to infer properties about an#
                  area's species, biodiversity, and health. Spatial acoustics takes this one step further,
                   by recording a soundwave from multiple microphones simultaneously we can use millisecond 
                   time differences to triangulate where a sound has come from. </p>

            
            <p> Using spatial acoustics, we can:</p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Track animal movement and behaviour without having to capture and collar them. </li>
                <li>Monitor behaviour. </li>
                <li>Monitor interactions.</li>
                <li>Separate sounds for further classification. </li>
                <li>Count how many individuals are present.</li>
                <li>And perhaps even more?</li>   
            </ul>

            <p> The most commonly cited blockades to spatial acoustics in long-term ecological research
                 are the equipment being expensive, inaccessible, requiring specific expertise, or only
                  being suitable for short term deployments.</p>
