            <h2>MAARU</h2>
            <p> MAARU is an exciting, accessible, low-cost option for those looking to 
                explore spatial soundscape ecology accurately and easily. Ultimately the added directional 
                element of the multichannel recording provided by MAARU allows for a new type of exploration 
                into sonic environments.</p>
                
            <p>We present a low-cost, open-source, 6-channel recorder built entirely from commercially 
                available components which can be integrated into a solar-powered, networked system. 
                The MAARU (Multichannel Acoustic Autonomous Recording Unit) works in long-term autonomous, 
                passive and ad-hoc deployments. We introduce MAARUs hardware and software, as well as the 
                results of lab and field tests investigating the device's durability, localisation accuracy, 
                and other applications. MAARU provides multichannel data with similar costs and power demands 
                to equivalent omnidirectional recorders. MAARU devices have been developed and tested in 
                deployments in the UK and Brazil, where we have shown MAARUs can localise pure tones up to 
                6kHz accurately and bird calls 8m away (±10° range). We also show how beamforming can be used on MAARU devices to improve BirdNET confidence 
                scores and recall.</p>
            
            <p>MAARU is set out as in the schematic below:</p>

            which are centred around a Raspberry Pi. The components are 1- connection to mobile networks via a 
            dongle, 2- a 6-channel circular microphone array, and 3- a renewable power source consisting of a solar 
            panel and a deep cycle battery moderated by a solar charge controller.", class = "schematic">
