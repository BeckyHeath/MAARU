        <div><p class = "body-text">Using algorithms developed for robot hearing, MAARU can be used to track sound 
            sources in near real-time. The MAARU provides an exciting, accessible, low-cost option for those
             looking to explore spatial soundscape ecology accurately and easily. Ultimately, the added directional 
             element of the multichannel recording provided by MAARU allows for a new type of exploration into 
             sonic environments. <br> <br>

       <div><p class = "body-text">We built MAARU as an adaptation of the SAFE Recorder, an autonomous 
        omnidirectional recorder which has recorded across the globe countries and currently sends a 
        live stream of data to a website you can tune in to here. 

        MAARU is a multichannel acoustic recorder that can run online or offline and can be powered by 
        batteries or autonomously through renewable energy sources. MAARU is designed to be built by 
        anyone. All the components are purchasable online, the code is all open source, and the only 
        technical expertise needed is the ability to use a screwdriver!
