                which are centred around a Raspberry Pi. The components are 1- connection to mobile networks via a 
                dongle, 2- a 6-channel circular microphone array, and 3- a renewable power source consisting of a solar 
                panel and a deep cycle battery moderated by a solar charge controller.", class = "schematic">


            <p> MAARU is an exciting, accessible, low-cost option for those looking to 
                explore spatial soundscape ecology accurately and easily. Ultimately the added directional 
                element of the multichannel recording provided by MAARU allows for a new type of exploration 
                into sonic environments.</p>
                
            <p>We built MAARU as an adaptation of the <a href="https://sarabsethi.github.io/autonomous_ecosystem_monitoring"
                 target="_blank">SAFE Recorder</a>, an autonomous omnidirectional recorder which has recorded across the 
                 globe countries and currently sends a live stream of data to a website you can tune in to 
                 <a href="http://acoustics.safeproject.net"
                 target="_blank">here</a></p> 
                 
            <p>MAARU is a multichannel acoustic recorder that can run online or offline and can be powered by batteries or 
                autonomously through renewable energy sources. MAARU is designed to be built by anyone. All the components 
                are purchasable online, the code is all open source, and the only technical expertise needed is the ability 
                to use a screwdriver!</p>
