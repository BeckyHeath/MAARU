                    sources in near real-time. The MAARU provides an exciting, accessible, low-cost option for those
                     looking to explore spatial soundscape ecology accurately and easily. Ultimately, the added directional 
                     element of the multichannel recording provided by MAARU allows for a new type of exploration into 
                     sonic environments. <br> <br>

                <p class = "body-text">We built MAARU as an adaptation of the SAFE Recorder, an autonomous 
                    omnidirectional recorder which has recorded across the globe countries and currently sends a 
                    live stream of data to a website you can tune in to here. 

                    MAARU is a multichannel acoustic recorder that can run online or offline and can be powered by 
                    batteries or autonomously through renewable energy sources. MAARU is designed to be built by 
                    anyone. All the components are purchasable online, the code is all open source, and the only 
                    technical expertise needed is the ability to use a screwdriver!
