            <h2>Building MAARU</h2>
            
            <p>MAARU recorders can be built cheaply and easily using just a power drill and a screwdriver. You’ll need to make sure you have all the kit first,
                so please see our non-exhaustive <a href="#kit-list">Kit List</a></p>

            <img src="images/Rpi-Array.png" alt = "Illustration of a Raspberry Pi, with a HAT, connectec to a 
            multichannel microphone array", 
            class = "tech-illustrations">


            <h3>The Basics:</h3>

            <p>The ReSpeaker 6-microphone array to the ReSpeaker HAT via the ribbon cable as above. Then, 
                attach the HAT and the array to the Pi via the 40-pin header on your raspberry Pi. </p> 

                
            <h3>Setting up the operating system </h3>

            <b>TIP:</b> Power the Rpi from mains when you do this it’ll be a lot easier! <br>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Set up the ReSpeaker 6-Mic hat. Full instructions on the ReSpeaker website. You’ll want to connect the circular array to the ReSpeaker HAT by the ribbon cable as below:</li>
                <li>Then attach the HAT to the Pi by the 40-pin header (don’t worry about affixing it all together with the white plastic screws. – you won’t need them).</li>
                <li>Insert the SIM card into the HUAWEI dongle</li>
                <li>Connect the dongle to the Raspberry Pi via the USB extension cable</li>
            </ul>
                                
            <h3>Setting up the OS:</h3>

            <p>You’ll need Wi-Fi or network connection to get everything set up. If you’re looking to autonomise your device by connecting it to mobile
                 networks, you can set that up now: </p>

                 <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Pay for a network subscription and activate your SIM card. SIM card activation usually involves making 
                        a phone call from your phone with the SIM inserted but can vary network-to-network. Make sure you can connect 
                        to the internet via the SIM on your phone first</li>
                    <li>Put the SIM into the USB dongle. </li>
                    <li>Plug the USB dongle into the raspberry pi.  </a></li>
                </ul>     
                
            <p>There are two options for setting up the operating system. 1) you can download our prebuilt OS here [link] 
                on to a micro-SD card or 2) <a href="https://github.com/BeckyHeath/multi-mic-recorder-analysis">follow instructions to set it up yourself here.</a> </p>
            
            <p>Once you've set up the operating system to a micro-SD, insert the micro-SD into your Raspberry Pi. You'll want to check that everything
                is working okay, so plug the Raspberry Pi into a screen and turn it on. It should pop up with information about 
                the recording, compression, and transmission status of the audio. If it's all working fine you can power down safely, and you're
                ready to go. You can look at our suggested methods for weatherproofing (here) or you can look at autonomising the device with autonomous power and below.  </p>

            <p><b>TIP:</b>Be careful not to suddenly unplug the raspberry Pi at any point. It’ll mess with the system. Instead, if you want to turn off the Pi: </p>
            <ul class = "bullet-list">
                <li>Press the button in the center of the array and wait for it to power down. </li>
                <li>Type “sudo halt” into the command line. </li>
                <li>Switch off the power source (wall plug or solar charge controller). </li>
            </ul>
                
            <img src="images/powering.png" alt = "Illustration of a solar panel, a battery and a solar charge 
            controller.", 
            class = "tech-illustrations">


            <h3>Powering:</h3>

            <p>Here we explain how to power your MAARU autonomously with solar power. If you have mains connection available you can just 
                plug into the wall. Similarly solar panels can be subbed for wind or other renewable power sources. </p>

            <p><b>If you don't want to power MAARU autonomously...</b> you should plug your pre-charged battery into a solar charge controller. Or
            if you are chosing to use a power bank with inbuilt charge moderation, you can plug right into the Pi</p>

            <p>For solar powered deployments...</p>

            <h3>Setting up the Waterproofing: </h3>

                Tip: Power down and unplug the device from the power source while you’re setting up the waterproofing 
                
                <h4>Raspberry Pi and microphone array waterproofing.</h4>

                <p>We present here two different methods of weatherproofing for MAARU, depending on whether or not you have access to a 3D Printer. For both, you’ll need acoustic weatherproof vents (details in kit list).  </p>

                <p>In both cases the described housing only covers the Raspberry Pi, and multichannel array. The battery and solar charge controller should be stored separately in a dri-bag to reduce interference. </p>

The 6 circular holes on top will line up with the MEMS microphones on the array while the 2 other holes will line up with two other protrusions on the surface of the array. Once all the holes have been made, sand down the edges and surrounding area to reduce risk of damage and increase surface area for adhesives to attach.

                        Attach the IPRO vents to the mic hole and lay electric tape over the other two holes and cover with sealant.
